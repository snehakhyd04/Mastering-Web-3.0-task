# Mastering-Web-3.0-task
The program has all the attributes and methods as given in the Recruitment task. I have assumed motion only x direction.
In the function time_to_collision, first if shows that if both the car's coordinates are same then, collision time is 0. The second if is for the car's moving in the same direction i.e. direction of speed is the same. Then I check if car 2 is forward then car1 has to have greater speed to collide(this is for +ve x direction), the else part checks if its in -ve x direction and car1 is before car2 then car2 has to gear up. The last else condition checks if both the cars are moving in opposite direction, then firstly if car1 moves in +x direction and car2 in -x direction then they collide(if car2 is forward), lastly if car1 is forward then car2 moves in +x direction and car1 in -x direction to collide.

Lastly, I have assumed and limited my code to a lot of things but would like to learn it all deeply through this project.
